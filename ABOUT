🚀 Features
Cleans and preprocesses text data (removes stopwords, punctuation, etc.)
Uses TF-IDF vectorization for text feature extraction
Trained on a labeled news dataset (real vs fake)
Machine Learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression / Naive Bayes) for classification
Interactive Streamlit web app where users can input text or headlines and get predictions in real time
